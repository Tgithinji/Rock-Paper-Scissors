# Project: Rock Paper Scissors

This is the first project in te foundations of javascript at the Odin Project curriculum. The goal of this project is to create a game enables a player to play a game of Rock Paer or scissors vs the computer.

In this project I've learnt the use of functions, arrays and how to manipulate the DOM elements.
